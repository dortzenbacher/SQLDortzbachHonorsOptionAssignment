# Project 2 -- Dortzbach Honors Option

# Data Set:
This data set was obtained from the US Data Government Website, and the publisher of the dataset is The City of New York. This dataset is a record of traffic crashes, including details like crash date, time, location, and contributing factors. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage and provides data that could be used for traffic safety analysis. This dataset could be used to analyze trends in traffic accidents, identify high-risk locations, and inform safety measures.

# Question:
**What are the forecasted percentages of collisions attributed to alcohol and to illegal drugs separately for the years 2025 and 2026?**

Importance: Forecasting the percentages of collisions caused by alcohol and illegal drugs for 2024 and 2025 provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of current interventions targeting impaired driving. It also serves as a key indicator of whether past efforts have been successful or if adjustments to strategies are needed.


# Manipulations:
 1. I filtered out data before 2016 because crashes caused by illegal drugs were not recorded during that time. Including 0% for illegal drug-related crashes prior to 2016 would innapropriately skew the results.

 2. 

list the manipulations and explain why i have them
