# Project 2 -- Dortzbach Honors Option

# Data Set:
This data set was obtained from the US Data Government Website, and the publisher of the dataset is The City of New York. This dataset is a record of traffic crashes, including details like crash date, time, location, and contributing factors. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage and provides data that could be used for traffic safety analysis. This dataset could be used to analyze trends in traffic accidents, identify high-risk locations, and inform safety measures.
